# Yada Language

## Project Short Term Goals
- [~] Get PoC of interpreter of base programming language in Python.
- [ ] Modify the frontent to fit with my own vision of the semantics of Yada.
- [ ] Implement compiler version in Python.

## Project Long Term Goals
- I'd like to re-implement the interpreter/compiler of Yada in multiple languages (this seems like a good way to become familiar with a new programming langage aswell).
